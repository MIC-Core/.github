The MIC Core specification is a free standard that defines a set of
harmonized model meta data attributes that meta-data standards can
adopt to avoid ambuity and incompatibility in common attributes across
domains and standards.

Releases and issues can be found on [github.com/MIC-Core/MIC-Core](https://github.com/MIC-Core/MIC-Core).
